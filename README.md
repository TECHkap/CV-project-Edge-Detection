# CV-project-Edge-Detection
Detection of edges with help of different operators (canny, laplacian and sobel)

- reduction of kernel size improves the edge detection quality with sobel and laplace in this example
- best results archived with canny operator, probably due to the algorithm of canny with non-maximum suppresion and hysteresis thresholding
